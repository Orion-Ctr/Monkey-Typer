# Monkey-Typer
This is a basic C++ GUI typing game utilizing the SFML library to make words or phrases move across the screen from one side to another in which the user’s goal is to type the appearing words to make them disappear. 
If a word isn’t typed (i.e., the user fails to remove it), it moves to the other side of the screen. When multiple words move across without being typed, the game ends.
